# Marceline DeVaughan

## Current
I am a junior working on a bachelors in Computer Science at Northwest Missouri State University.

## Background
I am from St. Louis, Missouri, and have had an interest in code since a young age, starting my first hobby projects in middle school. In high school I attended a technical program where I had the honor of competing in the SkillsUSA Web Design and Development challenge, earning a national goal medal. I have also recieved a Microsoft certification in Web Development and worked on several personal and group projects, including a bot for Discord that served hundreds of thousands of users at its peak.

## Plans
I have an interest in both software development and big data programming, and my dream job would be as a player analytics developer for an NHL team.
