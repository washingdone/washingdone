# Marceline DeVaughan

## Current
I am currently an IT Help Desk Technician for Schnucks' Markets, Inc.

## Background
I am from St. Louis, Missouri, and have had an interest in code since a young age, starting my first hobby projects in middle school. In high school I attended a technical program where I had the honor of competing in the SkillsUSA Web Design and Development challenge, earning a national goal medal. I have also recieved a Microsoft certification in Web Development and worked on several personal and group projects, including a bot for Discord that served hundreds of thousands of users at its peak. During College I participated in several clubs, including being the president of the Northwest Gaming club, where I oversaw several successful gaming conventions and worked closely with other clubs to pull them off. I also discovered my enjoyment of data processing and anaylitics during my Big Data course, eventually becoming the Teaching Assistant for the course for 2 semesters. During my time as a TA I was able to generate many useful documents and references for students, and I occasionally guest-taught sessions as well. 

## Plans
I have an interest in both software development and big data programming, and my current goal is to continue broadening my knoweledge of the company's operations and grow with them.
